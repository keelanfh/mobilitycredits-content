    <h2>Use this service to:</h2>
    <p>Exchange your car for mobility credits.</p>
    <p>This process takes around 15 minutes.</p>

    <p>If you exchange your car for mobility credits, you will receive a card that you can use to purchase transport
        tickets or service that you can use to travel instead of using your car.</p>

    <h2>What you'll need</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You will need your vehicle log book (V5C). This is so that we can confirm the vehicle you are exchanging for
            mobility credits is registered in your name.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete this form</li>
        <li>We send you a Yordex card with £100 on it, and a Swift card</li>
        <li>14 days later, we collect your car and scrap it</li>
        <li>We top up your Yordex card with the rest of your mobility credits (£2900)</li>
        <li>Spend your credits and enjoy travelling car-free!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What you will receive</h2>
    <p>After you've signed up for mobility credits, we'll send you two cards.</p>

    <p>The Yordex card is just like a debit card, but you can only use it to pay for transport services, like bus
        travel, train tickets, taxis or car hire. This card will have your personal mobility credits balance on it.
    </p>
    <p>We'll also send you a Swift card valid for travel on the bus, train or tram in the West Midlands for one week, to
        get you started. If you'd like to use your Swift card again, you can <a
            href="https://www.networkwestmidlands.com/tickets/#/">buy a season ticket</a> and pay using your Yordex
        card.</p>


    <h2 id="how-to-use-your-mobility-credits">How to use your mobility credits</h2>

    <p>Mobility credits can be spent on the bus, train, tram, taxi, car hire and car club in the West Midlands.</p>

    <h3 id="bus">Bus</h3>

    <p>Use your mobility credits on any bus in the West Midlands. Simply tap your Yordex card on the card reader when
        you board, and the fare will be deducted from your mobility credits balance.</p>

    <p>If you're travelling on the bus regularly, it might be cheaper to <a
            href="https://www.networkwestmidlands.com/tickets/#/" target="_blank">buy a season ticket</a>. You can load
        this onto your Swift card.</p>

    <h3 id="train">Train</h3>
    <p>Use your Yordex card to buy train tickets at a rail station ticket machine or ticket office, or use a mobile app
        like <a href="https://www.westmidlandsrailway.co.uk/" target="_blank">West Midlands Railway</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="car-club">Car club</h3>
    <p>You can <a href="https://enterprisecarclub.co.uk/gb/en/programs/regions/midlands/birmingham.html"
            target="_blank">sign up for Enterprise car club</a> for free and receive £x free credit. Use your Yordex
        card to pay for the car club.</p>

    <h3 id="taxi">Taxi</h3>
    <p>Use your Yordex card to pay for taxis or private hire vehicles. Taxi and private hire services in Coventry
        include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://gett.com/uk/city/coventry" target="_blank">Gett</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://uber.com/gb/en" target="_blank">Uber</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ola.co.uk/gb/" target="_blank">Ola</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Or you can hail a black cab in the street and pay using your Yordex card. </p>
